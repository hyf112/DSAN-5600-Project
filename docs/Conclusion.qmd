This research illuminates the inherent complexities and erratic nature of daily COVID-19 data, which, while being a rich resource for researchers, also poses numerous challenges and pitfalls in time series analysis. The study underscores the vast regional disparities in infection and mortality rates and the volatility in these figures, which highlight the limitations of current reporting and testing mechanisms, as well as the multitude of underlying trends and factors.

The application of ARMA/ARIMA models has proven potent, offering explanations for varying patterns in case and death numbers and aiding in short-term trend forecasting. This investigation also delved into more advanced models, like ARCH/GARCH, which, despite some fitting and predictive challenges, prompt further examination using more sophisticated techniques. Conversely, certain models exhibited promising predictive accuracy and stability, spurring continued refinement and application for forecasting COVID-19 trends and potentially other infectious diseases.

Additionally, the study explored the impact of vaccinations on new case numbers, indicating a mitigating effect on case growth. It also revealed a strong correlation between ICU admissions and new deaths, highlighting the critical role of medical resource allocation.

Nevertheless, constraints in technology and time precluded the exploration of other influential factors, such as climate and policy measures. The performance of some models requires further optimization. This research is a stepping stone, with the aspiration that future investigations will address these gaps and build upon the findings presented here.

COVID-19 has wrought considerable havoc, disrupting our daily lives and leading to the loss of many. However, I am confident that through collective human effort, we will ultimately prevail over this pandemic and emerge better prepared for any future global health crises.
